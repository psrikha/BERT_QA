# DeepLearning_HW3
•	Description:
Developed a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) based Language Model (LLM) using PyTorch for automated question answering. Utilized a dataset of 1000+ context sentences to achieve a precise answer prediction accuracy of 97%.
	•	Key Features:
	•	Implemented BERT architecture in PyTorch for question answering.
	•	Trained the model on a diverse dataset of context sentences.
	•	Achieved a high accuracy of 97% in answer prediction.
